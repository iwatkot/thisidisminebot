## How and why

This simple one-file Telegram bot built with `aiogram` and is designed for only one task: to show the user information about his Telegram account. It doesn't have any commands and handles all messages with one function and replies to the user with MD2 formatted message, which inclued all useful information about user's account. It's changes default object `message` keys to the more user-friendly text.<br>
At addition the bot stores logs and list of users which interact with it.
